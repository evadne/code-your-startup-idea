# She++ 2013 Workshop: Code Your Start-Up Idea

Everyone has an idea. Execution is everything. In this workshop, you will learn HTML and CSS so that you can begin prototyping your ideas. To get started, you’ll need an Internet connection, a browser with great debugging support, and a text editor.

## Next Steps

First, solidify basic knowledge with [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn)’s Web Fundamentals Track (HTML, CSS), then go on and finish its Javascript and Ruby Track. Continue solidifying your Ruby understanding with [TryRuby](http://tryruby.org), [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book) and [Why’s Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide).

You might want to then start working with [RailsGuides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org), [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com) or Michael Hartl’s [Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org). Also read the [API Reference](http://api.rubyonrails.org) if you need help.

If you want to start learning how to build iPhone apps, we recommend [iOS Programming](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007OWBAB0/) from the Big Nerd Ranch.
