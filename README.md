Why Code Your Start-Up Idea?
======================

Why code your start-up idea? Why code anything - why not just hire someone else to do it for you?

As you may have been observing - technology has been and will continue to revolutionize the world. Rocket science and medical devices aside, let's simply consider how web and mobile applications alone have the power to fundamentally change our behavior enable us to accomplish our needs and goals in life.  

Facebook, Amazon, Zappos, Instagram, Uber, Yelp.

Technology is an enabler. Well made tech products enable us to achieve faster, easier, cheaper. 

But changing the world isn't just about having ideas. Everyone can have ideas. What changes the world are the people who have the guts and determination to execute on their ideas and to make them become a reality. 

So, if you have an idea that's going to change the world - why would you outsource its creation - its development - to someone else? 

Execution is everything.
